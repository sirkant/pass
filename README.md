# pass

Are you also frustrated by how long it takes to get an appointment in Sweden?

Instead of checking every day for new released times, I did a python script to check the available times (in Halland) 
to get a passport and compare to my current date. 

url = the page of the region
target_month = your appointment's month
target_date = your appointment's day

Best of luck!
